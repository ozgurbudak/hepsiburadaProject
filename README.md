Django uses environment variables for setting up the postgres database. To correctly set up create a ".env" file with the following variables

DB_NAME,
DB_USER,
DB_PASSWORD,
DB_HOST,
DB_PORT,
SECRET_KEY

After that you can used "docker-compose up" to run the application. Frontend will be on http://localhost:8081/
